merb_wheels
===========

A plugin for the Merb framework that adds back of the more useful Rails view helpers.

Allows Rails developers to easily ramp up on Merb without.

We'll also provide a nice rake task that will allow you to find these Rails methods
and eventually convert them to Merb on your own schedule, without having stuff break.
